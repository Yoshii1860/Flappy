This is a coursework project from Harvard University`s CS50G.

# Implemented Features
Level Up the Challenge: The pipe generation logic has been revamped, introducing more complex patterns and variations. This creates a more dynamic and challenging experience for players.

Medal Moments: A brand new medal system has been implemented! Outstanding player performance, measured by score, is now rewarded with shiny medals, adding a layer of achievement and motivation.

Take a Break: Players can now take a breather and strategically pause the game at any time using a new pause functionality. This allows them to regroup and plan their next attempt at conquering the endless pipes.
