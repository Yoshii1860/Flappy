# Flappy
This is a coursework project from Harvard University`s CS50G.

# Implemented Features
Modified Pipe Generation: The logic responsible for generating pipe positions and configurations within the game has been altered. This modification aims to create a more challenging and dynamic gameplay experience.

Performance Medal System: A new system has been integrated into the game that awards medals based on the player's achieved score. This system serves as a form of recognition and motivation for high-performing players.

Pause Functionality Integration: The Flappy Bird game now includes a pause feature that players can activate at any point during gameplay. This allows them to take a break and strategize their next move before resuming the challenge.
